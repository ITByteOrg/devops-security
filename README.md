# Security Practices

Security is a core pillar of this DevOps journey. This document outlines the security policies and practices followed across all repositories in the DevOps stack.

---

## Overview

All repositories in this organization adhere to strict security standards to protect code, infrastructure, and sensitive information. These practices are reviewed and updated regularly as part of our DevOps workflow.

---

## Key Security Practices

- **Branch Protection:**  
  All main branches are protected with required reviews and status checks before merging.

- **Secrets Management:**  
  Secrets are never committed to the repository. Use GitHub Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or other secure secret management tools.

- **Automated Security Scanning:**  
  Tools such as SonarQube, Checkmarx, BlackDuck, TruffleHog, and Prisma Cloud are used for automated code and dependency scanning.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Dependencies are kept up to date, and vulnerability checks are performed regularly.

- **Access Control:**  
  Repository access is limited to authorized contributors. Least privilege principles are enforced.

- **Incident Response:**  
  Security incidents are reported and handled promptly. See the [Contact](#contact) section below.
